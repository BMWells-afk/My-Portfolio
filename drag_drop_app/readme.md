# BU CS601 - HW2 - Drag and Drop App

## Project Description
A simple drag and drop app that includes a 5 cat and 5 dog images, stored locally
- You can drag all the pet items.
- Categories are labeled on each so they show green (correct) and allow for drop if you drag over their respective category zones. or red (incorrect) and should NOT let you drop in that zone.
- I added some new CSS styles to help with the img formatting because I like my rounded borders
-Tried some new CSS styles

## Issues
- The hover "correct" does not turn green as it should
