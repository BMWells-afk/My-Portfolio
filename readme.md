## Project Description
A fun simple porfolio page showcasing Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer's professional abilities
- I added a logo with my initials to the header with text effects to the title
- Links to the sections of the page are in the nav header
- Has four project cards in a flex grid format, each with a fake link to said project
- I added a few psuedo-classes to change the hover of the links an the cards (this is where the christmas theme started to evolve)
- A sidebar showcases Rudoplph's profile photo with a short bio and email contact link 
- I added a psuedo-element to color the email list item 
- Footer displays a copyright symbol and my name
