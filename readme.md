# CS601 - Final Project - Portfolio

## Project Description
A porfolio page showcasing my projects 
- I added a custom icon and logo to the page 
- Has four project cards in a flex grid format, each with a link to the project
- The My Bakery Inventory app features TypeScript and React
- There is a drag and drop API app included
- There is a random cat image generator app that uses images (currently in an array, but would be cool to change to API)
- There is a fun portfolio page that uses 
- I added a few psuedo-classes to change the hover of the links and the cards
- A sidebar showcases my avatar profile photo with a short bio and a Contact Me button that has a nice hover and click effect
- The Contact Me button opens a page with a form that requires an email and description and provides a success alert once submitted
- The sidbar also includes three working icons for socials that changes color and size on hover. The icons pull from font-awesome 
- I added mobile responsiveness to the portfolio site and within the contact form and cat_generator apps
- Footer displays a copyright symbol with dynamic current year and my name
- Lots of custumized and expirimental CSS (I would make separate css files in the future to better organize, it became a long sheet)
