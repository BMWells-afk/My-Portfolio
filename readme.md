# CS601 - Final Project - Portfolio

## Project Description
A responsive porfolio page showcasing my projects and skills learned during the course

### Key Features
- **Projects**: Four project cards in a responsive grid layout, each linking to the their pages
  - My Bakery Inventory App (using TypeScript + React)
  - Cat and Dog Drag and Drop API App
  - Random Cat Image Generator (JavaScript with image array)
  - Fun experimental portfolio page for Rudoplph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
- **Interactive "Fun" UI Elements**:
  - Animated project cards with hover effects using CSS pseudo-classes
  - Shadow animated effect on my name header 
  - Neon flickering text animation on project header
  - Glowing rainbow border effect on contact button
- **Sidebar Profile Section**:
  - Custum avatar profile photo and page icon
  - Short bio
  - "Contact Me" button that links out to the Contact Form
  - Social media icons (used Font Awesome) with color and scale transitions
- **Contact Form Page**:
  - Email and message fields (required)
  - Success alert message displays when you "Submit" (doesn't actually send/disabled)
  - Responsive design optimized for mobile devices to help with sizing
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-friendly designs for the portfolio page (I was happily surprised this wasn't too difficult to implement, thought it would be more complex, but really just about screen sizes)
  - Sticky sidebar on desktop, stacked layout on mobile
- **Footer**:
  - Dynamic copyright year using JavaScript

## Future Enhancements
- Convert cat generator to use an external API so it can be more dynamic
- Organize CSS into individual files - the main styles.css became quite large
